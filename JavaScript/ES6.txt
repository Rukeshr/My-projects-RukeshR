Arrow Functions : anonymous functions
const myFunc = () => {
  const myVar = "value";
  return myVar;
}

Arrow Functions with Parameters : Just like a regular function, you can pass arguments into an arrow function

ex : const doubler = (item) => item * 2;
doubler(4); 

If an arrow function has a single parameter, the parentheses enclosing the parameter may be omitted.
ex : const doubler = item => item * 2;

Rest Parameter with Function Parameters :  With the rest parameter, you can create functions that take a variable number of arguments. These arguments are stored in an array that can be accessed later from inside the function.

A Promise is a proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is created. It allows you to associate handlers with an asynchronous action's eventual success value or failure reason. This lets asynchronous methods return values like synchronous methods: instead of immediately returning the final value, the asynchronous method returns a promise to supply the value at some point in the future.

A Promise is in one of these states:

pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
fulfilled: meaning that the operation was completed successfully.
rejected: meaning that the operation failed.

Regular expression : Are used to create match parts of string. test() method takes the regex, applies it to a string (which is placed inside the parentheses), and returns true or false if your pattern finds something or not.
ex : let testStr = "freeCodeCamp";
let testRegex = /Code/; // Case Sensitive
testRegex.test(testStr);

 search for multiple patterns using the alternation or OR operator: |

Ignore Case While Matching : /regex/i; i is the ignore case

extract the actual matches you found with the .match() method.

To search or extract a pattern more than once, you can use the global search flag: g.

let repeatRegex = /Repeat/g;
testStr.match(repeatRegex);

You can have multiple flags on your regex like /search/gi 

Match Anything with Wildcard Period : 
ex : let hugStr = "Bear hug";
let huRegex = /hu./;
huRegex.test(hugStr);

Returns true / false

Match Single Character with Multiple Possibilities
let bogStr = "bog";
let bgRegex = /b[aiu]g/;
bogStr.match(bgRegex);

Match Letters of the Alphabet : you can define a range of characters to match using a hyphen character: -.
let matStr = "mat";
let bgRegex = /[a-e]at/;
matStr.match(bgRegex);
